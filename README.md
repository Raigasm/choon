**choon** is a node.js command line tool using Offliberty to download a YouTube video as MP3.

## Installation
In terminal:
`npm install -g choon`

## Usage
Browse youtube and find a choon.

In terminal,
`choon <youtube url>`

### Download Destination
By default, **choon** downloads to `~/Downloads/`, ie. the default downloads folder on OSX/some Linux distributions.

To specify a target directory, simply use `choon <youtube url> <target directory>`.

**NB:** do NOT add the filename to the end of the directory. **choon** does this automatically.
